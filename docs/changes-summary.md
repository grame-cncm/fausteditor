# Faust Editor Modernization Overview

This document records the structural refactor completed on the `refactor-editor-runtime` branch.

## Runtime And Fetch Pipeline

- Added `src/utils/network.js` to consolidate `fetch` helpers with a timeout guard, used across the editor and FaustWeb integrations.
- Reworked `src/faustlive.js` drag-and-drop logic to eliminate implicit globals and synchronous `XMLHttpRequest` usage. Dropped files/URLs are now processed asynchronously with richer error handling.
- Updated `src/ExportLib.js` and `src/exportUI.js` to rely on promise-based `fetch` calls, improving fault reporting for target discovery, source upload, and remote compilation.

## State & Audio Improvements

- Migrated local storage management (`src/localStorage.js`) from array tuples to JSON objects, automatically migrating legacy data and skipping redundant writes.
- Normalised numeric settings and upgraded audio input activation in `src/runfaust.js` to prefer `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`, with legacy fallbacks retained.

## UI Event Wiring

- Removed inline handlers from `index.html` and introduced `wireUiEvents()` in `src/faustlive.js` to bind toolbar, modal, and configuration events programmatically.
- Simplified the entry script in `index.html` to a single `import "./src/faustlive";`, reducing the global surface area and easing CSP hardening.

## Tooling

- Added ESLint (`package.json`, `.eslintrc.cjs`) and a `npm run lint` script to catch regressions in `src/`.
- Documented each major migration in `docs/steps/step-01-setup.md` through `step-04-tooling.md` for granular traceability.

## Build Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds and emits the optimized Vite bundle. Vite warns that Node.js 20.9.0 is below the preferred 20.19.0; upgrading Node will quiet the notice but is not required for the build to pass.

Feedback welcomeâ€”let me know if you would like additional lint rules, automated tests, or parity updates to the `faustlive-wasm` demo entry point.
