# Step 01 â€“ Project Setup

- Created feature branch `refactor-editor-runtime` to contain the refactor work.
- Established `docs/steps/` directory to log each major change set as requested.
- Captured current repository state (clean working tree on top of `master`).

This step prepares the workspace and documentation trail before applying code changes.
